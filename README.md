## ✍️ **Reflection**

### What went well:
- **Creative Design:** I didn't know what I was going for in the beginning, but I am happy with how the player and enemy sprites turned out.
- **Core Mechanics:** I really wanted to have combat that felt responsive, turning the enemies into bloodsplatters was the perfect solution.

### Challenges:
- **Cut Content:** The game was supposed to have a camera follow the player and gravity as well, after a week I gave up on those features.

### Lessons Learned:
- **Starting over:** I made many early versions of my game with different cameras and gravity, I learned a lot from that even if I didn't use that in the end.
- **Prototyping:** I started over many times and made many versions and prototypes of different functions to see what worked best, in the end it was worth it.
