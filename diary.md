Today I managed to implement a sprite loader and I can put things on the screen and move them around with the keyboard. Tomorrow I will try to make an example level layout and test collision.

Today I spent most of the day trying to find a bug with one of my classes, but at the end I managed to implement everything that I wanted. Tomorrow I will start doing some basic physics and add the first enemies.

Today I finally gave up on the seperate camera. I made the player stationary and made the map move around him. Lucas then helped me for two hours to make a new gravity engine.

Today I gave up on the gravity, so now my game is 3d Topdown. I implemented spider enemies that crawl on the floor (If I fix the gravity they crawl on the wall, very clever) and I made a new hitbox for the player that only activates if he presses "j" on the keyboard, I also drew some sprites...
