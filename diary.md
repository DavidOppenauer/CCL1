Today I managed to implement a sprite loader and I can put things on the screen and move them around with the keyboard. Tomorrow I will try to make an example level layout and test collision.

Today I spent most of the day trying to find a bug with one of my classes, but at the end I managed to implement everything that I wanted. Tomorrow I will start doing some basic physics and add the first enemies.

Today I finally gave up on the seperate camera. I made the player stationary and made the map move around him. Lucas then helped me for two hours to make a new gravity engine.

Today I tried to fix the gravity fuction... no luck.

Today I gave up on the gravity, so now my game is 3d Topdown. I implemented spider enemies that crawl on the floor (If I fix the gravity they crawl on the wall, very clever) and I made a new hitbox for the player that only activates if he presses "j" on the keyboard, I also drew some sprites. I implemented knockback and leave enemy corpse the floor

Today I fixed the enemys glitching through the floor by making a better gameloop with the help of lucas. Then i made keyObjects and an exit if you have all the keys. Also the player has health now and disappears when he dies.

Today I made a main Menu with a start button and drew Sprites for walking and attacking for the player.

Today I drew the Enemys, completed the different gameScreens...
