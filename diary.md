Today I familiarized myself with the base template Lucas provided us, I made a map, that the player could jump around in and made an enemy with the pacman ghost AI.

Today I tried making the movement triggers of the basetemplate vertical. So that the camera draws the level around diffent axes, it didn't work. Then I started working on making a new camera system based on a Youtube Tutorial, I molded the code from the video into a more overseeable structure like in the base template, because the guy in the video has EVERYTHING in one .js File, yuck!

15/1/25
Today I gave up on the tutorial video and started all over AGAIN!, this time I am only going to use the camera of a certain other Tutorial video that looks promising. It functions by only drawing the canvas in a certain spot and moving that spots x and y coordinates.

The camera works today I tried to make the gravity work with said camera, I didn't end up working!

17/1/25
Today I finally gave up on the seperate camera. I started all over again and made the player stationary and made the map move around him. Lucas then helped me for two hours to make a new gravity engine.

Today I tried to fix the gravity fuction... no luck.

19/1/25
Today I gave up on the gravity, so now my game is 3d Topdown. I implemented spider enemies that crawl on the floor (If I fix the gravity they crawl on the wall, very clever) and I made a new hitbox for the player that only activates if he presses "j" on the keyboard, I also drew some sprites. I implemented knockback and leave enemy corpses the floor.

Today I fixed the enemys glitching through the floor by making a better gameloop with the help of lucas. Then i made keyObjects and an exit if you have all the keys. Also the player has health now and disappears when he dies.

21/1/25
Today I made a main Menu with a start button and drew Sprites for walking and attacking for the player.

22/1/25
Today I drew the Enemys, completed the different gameScreens...

23/1/25
Today I fixed all the Sprites for Enemies and implemented a Health bar for the Player. Also fixed the key collecting system and its sprites.

24/1/25
Today I presented.
